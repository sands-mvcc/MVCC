            <h2>I. Lesson Overview & What is GAAP?</h2>
            <p>**GAAP** is the standardized framework governing financial accounting and reporting for U.S. public companies. It ensures **consistency, transparency, and comparability** in financial statements, which is crucial for **investors** and **regulators**.</p>
            <p><strong>Governing Bodies:</strong> The <span class="key-term">Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)</span> creates and maintains GAAP (authoritative source: the <span class="key-term">FASB Accounting Standards Codification</span>). The <span class="key-term">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span> enforces compliance for publicly traded companies.</p>

        <section id="assumptions">
            <h2>II. The Four Fundamental Assumptions (The Foundation)</h2>
            <p>These four concepts are the bedrock upon which all GAAP rules are built. They are presumed to be true for financial reporting.</p>

            <h3>A. Business Entity Assumption</h3>
            <p>The business is treated as completely separate from its owner(s), managers, and other businesses.</p>
            <div class="analogy">
                **Analogy:** Think of the business as a separate legal person with its own wallet. If a CEO pays a personal mortgage with their own money, it **never** appears in the company's financial records.
            </div>

            <h3>B. Going Concern Assumption</h3>
            <p>It is assumed the business will continue operating indefinitely for the foreseeable future, rather than liquidating.</p>
            <div class="analogy">
                **Analogy:** If you buy a laptop for your course work, you assume you'll use it for years, allowing you to depreciate its cost over that time. If you thought you'd quit school next month, you'd expense the whole thing immediately (liquidation view). GAAP assumes the **long-term view**.
            </div>

            <h3>C. Monetary Unit Assumption</h3>
            <p>Only transactions that can be expressed in a monetary unit (like U.S. Dollars) are recorded. The unit is assumed to be stable.</p>
            <div class="analogy">
                **Analogy:** You can record the **cost** of a brilliant team ($X in salaries), but you cannot record the **value** of their "brilliance" or "morale" on the balance sheet, even though it clearly has economic value.
            </div>

            <h3>D. Time Period Assumption</h3>
            <p>A business's financial life can be divided into artificial time periods (e.g., months, quarters, years) for reporting.</p>
            <div class="analogy">
                **Analogy:** This is like a TV show with distinct seasons. You evaluate the success of Season 1 (a year) separately from Season 2, even though the story (the business) is continuous.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="principles">
            <h2>III. The Ten Core GAAP Principles (Ethical Framework)</h2>
            <p>These principles emphasize the importance of **integrity** and **full, standardized disclosure** in financial reporting.</p>
            
            <div class="interactive-box" onclick="toggleDetail('prudence')">Click to Explore: Principle of Prudence (Conservatism) üßê</div>
            <div id="prudence" class="concept-detail">
                **Description:** Choose the reporting method that has the **least favorable immediate impact** when multiple options exist. **Do not overstate assets or income.**<br>
                **Example:** When estimating potential losses from bad debts, an accountant should err on the side of caution and record a slightly higher estimate of uncollectible accounts, reducing reported income now. This is the **"Anticipate all losses, recognize gains only when certain"** rule.
            </div>

            <div class="interactive-box" onclick="toggleDetail('consistency')">Click to Explore: Principle of Consistency üîÅ</div>
            <div id="consistency" class="concept-detail">
                **Description:** Mandates the use of **uniform accounting methods** from period to period to allow for accurate comparison of financial data.<br>
                **Analogy:** Like measuring a child's height: you must use the same ruler, from the same spot on the floor, every time. If you change the method (e.g., from FIFO to LIFO for inventory), you must **disclose** and **explain** it.
            </div>

            <div class="interactive-box" onclick="toggleDetail('disclosure')">Click to Explore: Principle of Full Disclosure üí°</div>
            <div id="disclosure" class="concept-detail">
                **Description:** Financial statements must include **all information necessary** for users to make informed decisions. This is done primarily through **footnotes** and supplemental schedules.<br>
                **Example:** Disclosing a potential $50 million loss from a pending lawsuit, even if the outcome is uncertain, is mandatory because it is **material** (significant enough to affect a decision).
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="specific-principles">
            <h2>IV. Key Accounting Principles (The Mechanics)</h2>
            <p>These principles directly guide the day-to-day recording of transactions.</p>

            <h3>A. Historical Cost Principle</h3>
            <p>Assets and liabilities are recorded at their **acquisition cost** (the price paid for them) and generally remain at that value.</p>
            <div class="analogy">
                **Analogy:** Your personal journal entry for an asset is the price tag you paid for it. If you bought an antique chair for $100 and it's now worth $10,000, it remains $100 in your records. This provides **objectivity** and **verifiability** but sacrifices **current value** relevance.
            </div>

            <h3>B. Revenue Recognition Principle (ASC 606)</h3>
            <p>Revenue is recognized (recorded) when a company **satisfies its performance obligation** (earns it), **regardless of when cash is received.** This is the core of **Accrual Accounting**.</p>
            <div class="analogy">
                **Example:** A graphic designer completes a logo design for a client (performance obligation satisfied) on December 30th. The invoice is sent and payment is expected in January. **Revenue must be recognized in December**, not January, because the work was *earned*.
            </div>

            <h3>C. Matching Principle</h3>
            <p>Expenses incurred to generate revenue must be recognized in the **same period** as the revenue they helped create.</p>
            <div class="analogy">
                **Analogy:** The Matching Principle is like a business partner to the Revenue Recognition Principle. If you spend $1,000 on advertisements in January, but those ads generate $5,000 in sales revenue in February, the $1,000 expense is "matched" to the $5,000 revenue and recorded in **February**.
            </div>
        </section>

        ---

        <section id="constraints">
            <h2>V. The Four Key Constraints (Modifying Rules for Practicality)</h2>
            <p>Constraints ensure that GAAP principles are applied in a **practical and useful** manner.</p>

            <div class="interactive-box" onclick="toggleDetail('materiality')">Click to Explore: Materiality üìè</div>
            <div id="materiality" class="concept-detail">
                **Description:** An item is **material** if its omission or misstatement could **influence the economic decisions of users** of the financial statements.<br>
                **Example:** A company buys a $25 stapler. While technically it's a long-lived asset, GAAP allows the company to **expense it immediately** (bypass depreciation) because $25 is **immaterial** compared to the company's total assets. You apply a rule *only* if it makes a meaningful difference.
            </div>

            <div class="interactive-box" onclick="toggleDetail('objectivity')">Click to Explore: Objectivity (Verifiability) ‚úÖ</div>
            <div id="objectivity" class="concept-detail">
                **Description:** Financial information must be based on **objective evidence** that can be **verified** by independent parties (like auditors). This minimizes bias.<br>
                **Example:** An asset is recorded at its purchase price (historical cost) because that value can be verified with a receipt or contract, unlike a subjective opinion of its current market value.
            </div>
            
            <p>*(The remaining constraints, Consistency and Conservatism/Prudence, reinforce the principles previously discussed, ensuring they are applied practically.)*</p>

            <h2>Assessment Questions & Case Studies</h2>
            
            <h3>Application Question: Historical Cost</h3>
            <div class="interactive-box" onclick="toggleDetail('q_cost')">
                **Q:** A company buys a plot of land for $1,000,000. Five years later, an appraisal values the land at $3,500,000. At what value should it be reported on the Balance Sheet under GAAP?
            </div>
            <div id="q_cost" class="concept-detail">
                **Answer:** **$1,000,000.** The **Historical Cost Principle** requires reporting assets at their acquisition cost, not their current fair value. This ensures objectivity.
            </div>

            <h3>Application Question: Conservatism Constraint</h3>
            <div class="interactive-box" onclick="toggleDetail('q_conservatism')">
                **Q:** A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug. The potential profit is $500 million, but the potential liability from patient lawsuits is $20 million. Which figure must be recognized now?
            </div>
            <div id="q_conservatism" class="concept-detail">
                **Answer:** The **$20 million potential loss** should be recognized (or at least disclosed as a contingent liability) immediately, while the **$500 million potential gain** is ignored until the drug is successfully sold and revenue is realized. This is the **Conservatism Constraint**.
